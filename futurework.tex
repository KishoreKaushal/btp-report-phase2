\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this report, we first highlighted a conventional approach for image compression and then we discussed an AI based modification. In JPEG compression a suitable quality factor is set at the beginning with no knowledge of the compression ratio versus image quality. In contrast, the latter method provided a way by which a suitable quality factor is automatically decided by the model.
